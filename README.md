# Blockchain-Transaction-and-Market-Analysis
**Project Overview**
Welcome to the Blockchain Transaction and Market Analysis repository! This project provides a comprehensive analysis of blockchain transaction data, specifically focusing on Ethereum and Bitcoin. Through this analysis, we explore key metrics such as transaction volume, value distribution, and market trends, coupled with predictive modeling to forecast future price movements.

**Key Features:**
Data Extraction: Retrieve detailed transaction data from the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains using Web3.py and the Blockstream API.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze transaction volumes, value distributions, and unique address participation to identify trends and anomalies.
Cross-Chain Comparison: Conduct in-depth comparisons between Ethereum and Bitcoin metrics to understand their distinct behaviors and user bases.
Predictive Modeling: Utilize the Prophet library to forecast Ethereum prices through December 2024, providing valuable insights for investors and analysts.
Data Visualization: Generate insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively communicate findings.
Open-Source Contribution: Contribute to the blockchain and data science community by sharing tools, methods, and insights that can be built upon or adapted for other projects.

**Why This Project?**
Blockchain technology is rapidly transforming industries by enabling decentralized, secure, and transparent systems. Understanding blockchain transaction data is crucial for developers, analysts, and investors looking to make informed decisions in the crypto space. This project equips you with the tools and knowledge to explore and analyze blockchain data, helping you stay ahead in the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi).

**Technologies Used:**
